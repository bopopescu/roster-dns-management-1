#summary Installation of Roster Server
## Roster Server Setup ##
Installation of Roster User Tools is as follows:

> From pypi:
```
# easy_install RosterServer
```

> From source package:
```
# python setup.py install
```

## Starting Roster Server ##
The init.d script from **`roster_database_bootstrap`** will need to be configured if it needs to be autostarted on system boot. Details of this process can be found at the [init script installation](InitScriptInstallation.md) page.

The config file generated by **`roster_database_bootstrap`** should be [configured](CoreInstallation#Configuration.md) before running Roster Server.

If **_/etc/init.d/rosterd_** has been [properly configured](InitScriptInstallation.md), Roster Server can be started by running
**_/etc/init.d/rosterd start_**

Roster Server is now listening for commands.
