#summary Details Roster Server config file

# Roster Config File #

The Roster Server config file is used by Roster Server on server startup to automatically configure a number of options. Running the roster\_database\_bootstrap user tools script will generate this file, leaving few modifications needed before running the Roster Server.

## Set Up ##

By running the roster\_database\_bootstrap script an auto-generated roster\_server.conf (or whatever name was specified) file is created at the specified location. This file is world-readable and will need its file permissions changed to non-world-readable before Roster Server will start. You will also need to manually modify the **_`'server_killswitch'`_** option under the **_`[server]`_** section to be **_`'off'`_**. This will allow rosterd to start assuming other configuration values are correct.
